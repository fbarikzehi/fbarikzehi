## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Fereidoon**, a passionate **Software Engineer** and **Full-Stack Developer** with over **10 years of experience** crafting scalable backend systems, sleek frontend interfaces, and robust cloud architectures.  

I thrive at the intersection of performance, design, and real-world impact — from **microservices** to **AI-enhanced platforms**.

I believe great code isn't just functional — it's **intuitive**, **testable**, and **built for humans**.
